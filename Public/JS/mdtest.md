# HCI & Music, Evaluating tools for supporting creative work [4/23/13]

## Things

### Computer music
- Ada Lovelace
- 1950s: computer music feasible, pretty sophisticated
    - speech synthesis, instrumental-y
    - Hal referencing that. holy shit.
- making completely new sounds
- more control over instruments or something?
- musical illusion of forever descending crazy thing. yeah, that one.
- plork: innovation = everyone gets their own speaker. social dynamics mirror acoustic ensemble.
- chuck:
    - do complicated things efficiently
    - designed for playing "sound in time"
    - general definition of music.
    - unit generator. output sine wave.
    - meow.
    - what other abstractions might we use to make sounds?
    - chuck has built in physical
    - change mandolin body size from one note to the next
    - combine into chords, into rhythms or melodies
    - run code in parallel instead of forking threads, spork shreds. what.
    - virtual conductor for free.
- fm synthesis.
    - I wasn't really listening here.
- bonnie's thing!
    - students and scholars

### Wekinator as design tool
- interview users
- give 2 teams a broad goal, have other people evaluate results
- who's still using it in 3 years? externally valid.
- do we care more about the finished project or how they feel using it?

### Participatory / user centered design
- design that comes out of an interesting politicized approach to design in scandinavia:
    - get users heavily involved in prototyping
- retrospective interviews
- does it work?

### Playing live music over the internet
- problem: latency
- delay ain't cool yo.
- under 30ms ideal, deal with ~50ms.

## Fantastic quotations    
"You can just declare a mandolin."
"I stole some of these slides from Bonnie."
